Module 6 - Homework David Mostacero


Challenge is Divided in 2 documents WeatherPy and Vacation Py.

WeatherPy creates dataframes that are exported to a CSV file on the folder Output data.

It also does an analysis and plots the data to different images, which all are stored on the same folder.

A log file in a TXT document is created showing the cities that are being registered.


The CSV created on WeatherPy is later used by VacationPy document to create some Gmaps figures.

A HeatMap with markers and symbols was created and saved as PNG on the same Output Data Folder.
